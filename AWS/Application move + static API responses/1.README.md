Recently, we had to move and old production application (code written and deployed in 2015) from one AWS account into another, due to companies separaion following one of the companies aquisition.
So, the application was deployed under account A, and had to be moved into account B.
During the investigation it was found that it uses backend of the account A, that is not part of the account B bussiness. 
The app is not being updted, and the contnet is static. 
The purpose of this project is to show how to:
	1.	Cut off old API endpoints
	2.	Capture API requests and responses (before shutdown)
	3.	Store them on S3
	4.	Serve future requests via CloudFront from S3
Initially, Lambda@EDGE was considered the best solution, but since Cloudfront does not cache API responses, API Gateway with Labmda function as a proxy was the best approach.
Architecture of this solution looks like this:

Client → CloudFront (optional) → API Gateway → Lambda (proxy + logger) → External API
